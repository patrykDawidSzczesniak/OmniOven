# OmniOven
My first design based project: https://patrykdawidszczesniak.github.io/OmniOven/

I'd like to point out that Omni Oven brand is absolutely fictional, and created by me (it was created because I didn't remember the Opti Grill name correctly).
Right now the webpage only consists of main page and all the links used are attached directly to it, however in coming weeks I'm planning on adding more pages.

During this project I've used Fonts Awesome icons, fonts from Google Fonts and pictures from Pexels. From my understanding all of this sources are free to use, when it comes to pictures I've kept all the original names, so everyone can find them (I think that their authors did a great job!).

The RWD right now is not existing but I'm planning on working on that too.

I think it's all for now, thanks for read!
